# Portfolio
Welcome to the Portfolio repository! This repository is a collection of coding projects and research papers, with a strong focus on cybersecurity. Here, you’ll find tools, scripts, and studies that explore various cybersecurity themes, from encryption and fraud detection to advanced research topics on social engineering and network security.

# About
The Projects repository is divided into two main sections:

**#1.** Coding Projects – Practical tools and scripts that address specific challenges in cybersecurity, such as encryption and fraud detection.

**#2.** Research Papers – In-depth analyses and papers on emerging topics in cybersecurity, offering insights and research-backed conclusions.

Each project or paper is organized in its own folder, containing the necessary documentation to help you understand the purpose, implementation, and findings.


# Coding Projects
The Coding Projects section includes Python-based tools and utilities. Here are some of the highlighted projects:

RSA-Based Encryption Tool
A Python tool that encrypts messages using the RSA algorithm. It allows users to input two prime numbers, generating public and private keys for secure encryption and decryption.

Login Attempt Counter
This program counts login attempts and locks the account after a specified number of failed attempts. Useful for demonstrating concepts related to account security and brute-force attack mitigation.

Predictive Data Mining with Credit Card Fraud Detection
A predictive model that analyzes transaction data to detect fraudulent activity, leveraging data mining techniques to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
